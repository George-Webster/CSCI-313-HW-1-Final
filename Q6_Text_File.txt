A group of hospitals in Pennsylvania began delaying surgeries and turning away patients. 
A Cadbury factory in Tasmania stopped churning out chocolates. The pharmaceutical giant
Merck ceased manufacturing vaccines for human papillomavirus. Soon, seventeen terminals
at ports across the globe, all owned by the world’s largest shipping firm, Maersk, found
themselves paralyzed. Tens of thousands of eighteen-wheeler trucks carrying shipping 
containers began to line up outside those ports’ gates. Massive ships arrived from 
journeys across oceans, each carrying hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo, only to find
that no one could unload them. Like victims of a global outbreak of some brain-eating
bacteria, major components in the intertwined, automated systems of the world seemed to
have spontaneously forgotten how to function. At the attack’s epicenter, in Ukraine, the 
effects of the technological doomsday were more concentrated. ATMs and credit card payment
systems inexplicably dropped off-line. Mass transit in the country’s capital of Kiev was
crippled. Government agencies, airports, hospitals, the postal service, even scientists 
monitoring radioactivity levels at the ruins of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, all 
watched helplessly as practically every computer in their networks was infected and wiped
by a mysterious piece of malicious code. This is what cyberwar looks like: an invisible
force capable of striking out from an unknown origin to sabotage, on a massive scale, 
the technologies that underpin civilization.
